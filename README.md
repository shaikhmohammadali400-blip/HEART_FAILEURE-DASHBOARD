## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains medical records of **299 heart failure patients** with multiple attributes.

### Features in Dataset:

| Feature Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| age | Age of the patient |
| anaemia | Whether the patient has anaemia (0 = No, 1 = Yes) |
| creatinine_phosphokinase | Level of enzyme in blood |
| serum_creatinine | Level of creatinine in blood |
| ejection_fraction | Percentage of blood pumped by heart |
| platelets | Platelet count |
| serum_sodium | Sodium level in blood |
| sex | Gender (0 = Female, 1 = Male) |
| smoking | Smoking status |
| DEATH_EVENT | Target variable (1 = Death, 0 = Survived) |

- **Total Records:** 299  
- **Target Variable:** DEATH_EVENT

## 📈 Key Insights

From the analysis, the following insights were observed:

- Older patients show higher death risk  
- High serum creatinine is strongly related to mortality  
- Anaemia is common among heart failure patients  
- Certain medical parameters directly affect survival  

These insights help in understanding critical health indicators.
